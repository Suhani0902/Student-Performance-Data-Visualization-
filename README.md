# Student-Performance-Data-Visualization-
Data Visualization on Students Performance dataset using Python 3 and Matplotlib,Seaborn and Pandas

 Student Performance Data Visualization

This project focuses entirely on **Data Visualization** using the *Student Performance Dataset*.
The goal is to communicate insights visually — showing how gender, parental education, test preparation, and other factors influence students’ academic outcomes in math, reading, and writing.
Through a variety of visual plots, this project highlights trends, comparisons, and correlations that shape overall student performance.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* **Python 3**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Seaborn**
* **Pandas**


## 📊 Visualizations Included

### 1️⃣ **Score Distribution**

* **Purpose:** To show how students’ scores are distributed across Math, Reading, and Writing.
* **Visualization Used:** Histograms and KDE plots.
* **Insight:** Reading and writing scores are more balanced, while math has a slightly wider spread.

---

### 2️⃣ **Gender-Based Comparison**

* **Purpose:** To compare average performance between male and female students.
* **Visualization Used:** Bar charts & grouped boxplots.
* **Insight:** Female students tend to outperform male students in reading and writing.

---

### 3️⃣ **Parental Education Impact**

* **Purpose:** To understand how parents’ education level affects student performance.
* **Visualization Used:** Boxplots.
* **Insight:** Higher parental education correlates with higher average scores across all subjects.

---

### 4️⃣ **Test Preparation Effect**

* **Purpose:** To compare performance between students who completed a test prep course vs those who didn’t.
* **Visualization Used:** Side-by-side bar charts.
* **Insight:** Students who completed the course scored significantly better.

---

### 5️⃣ **Correlation Heatmap**

* **Purpose:** To visualize relationships between math, reading, and writing scores.
* **Visualization Used:** Seaborn heatmap.
* **Insight:** All three subjects show strong positive correlation — improvement in one often reflects in others.

---

### 6️⃣ **Race/Ethnicity Performance**

* **Purpose:** To explore performance trends across different ethnic groups.
* **Visualization Used:** Violin plots or bar plots.
* **Insight:** Some groups show consistent performance across all subjects, while others have greater variation
